# Python Games

Using this repo to help distribute a script with Multiple Python games in it. The script is basically my way to learning more about Python and working with it. 

## Description

This script is something I'm using to learn more about python and working with different aspects of it. Currently it has an option for Rock Paper Scissors. Currently working on a Guess the number game addition to it.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.10
  * Uses the random pythom Module
    * Installed by default

### Installing

* Just need to paste the contents of this file, or perform a git clone of the repo.
* As long as pythong 3.10 is installed on the computer running it, it should work

### Executing program

* Just need to call the Script file using Python3
```
python3 /location/to/install/main.py
```

## Help

This is a work in progress, so things may go up and down between updates.
